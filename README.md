# ARIMA Time Series Forecasting - Python to R

Created by Rafal K and Marcin Z.

This project is a reproduction and hopefully an extension of ARIMA Time Series Forecasting - S&P 500 Stock by Yassine Sfaihi.The aim of the research is to verify whether the S&P 500 market price can be acurately forecasted using conventional time series analysis tools.In the extension of the project, the ARIMA model will be compared with a much more advanced machine learning technique - neural networks.

# Quickstart
